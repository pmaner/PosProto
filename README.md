Here is the Code test you asked for. It has just tested on android and iOS phone simulators.
It has no provisioning profile so you can’t install it on you actual phones unless you add one.
This was created on Visual Studio for Mac, I am not sure how well it will go if you just load into the PC.

The interface is very basic, you can set if the minimums are configured for 
- nothing (“No Mins”) 
- just the Gadget (“Gadget Min”) or 
- for everything (“All Min”).

with the buttons at the top.

You can press “Discount Total” button and enter a new total. Then press the “Confirm New Total” to apply it.
To reset just put in a zero or larger number than the total.

There is also an xUnit test project that just checks the examples from the Test document.

I have created a brief video of it running on the ios simulator, you can down at

I've just put in in my drop box as it's 25 Mb.
